- 📱 Responsive design

## 🛠️ Built With

- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Lucide Icons

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chicken-teriyaki-cup-rice/llm-learn

# Install dependencies
cd llm-learn
npm install

npx shadcn-ui@latest add card button input


# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## 📖 Usage

1. Enter any text in the input field
2. Click "Next Step" to walk through each phase of LLM processing
3. See visual representations of how LLMs handle text at each stage
4. Click "Generate Output" in the final step to see simulated results
5. Use "Reset" to start over
